## Milestone 5
### General information

Twitter renamed itself to X back in July 2023. While corporate renames aren't unusual, in most cases these leave the name of the actual services intact (as was the case when Facebook renamed itself to Meta). Further, few names have entered the general lexicon as much as Twitter, which was a widely understood concept. The confusion caused by the rename led to the Associated Press updating its guidebook to recommend that news sites use "X, formerly known as Twitter" whenever they refer to the platform for the first time in a article, and only use X as a stand alone after that.

It is therefore interesting to know to what degree the rename has actually succeeded in changing what term the average user on the afore mentioned platform uses.

### Research question

Research Question: How has the usage of X vs Twitter to refer to the social media platform on Twitter changed.

### Hypothesis

Hypothesis: Twitter is still the dominant term for the platform

### Method


Gather tweets for two points in time: 2 months before the change and 6 months after. For each point in time take a random sample of 5% of the total tweets send on that day, measure the amount of times  either Twitter or X was used as a noun in a tweet, as a percentage of the total amount of tweets.
